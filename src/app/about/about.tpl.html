    <h2>GENERAL</h2>
    <p>
      Dax Digital Design is just me, Dax Borges. I started Dax Digital Design while studying at the University of Denver. Since graduating in 2008, I have worked with wonderful clients whose needs have ranged from simple icons to large scale data driven websites.

    <h2>DESIGN</h2>
    <p>
      I love clean typography, creating beautiful word marks and building intuitive UIs. I'm well versed in the Adobe Suite, with focus on Illustrator and Photoshop.

    <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
    <p>
      I've worked in many languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, PHP, Ruby, Python, ActionScript and ColdFusion. I enjoy creating beautiful and maintainable code; appropriate design patterns are a good start! My current favorite frameworks are Laravel and AngularJS.
