    <h2>GENERAL</h2>
    <p>
      Dax Digital Design is just me, Dax Borges. I've never been one to choose the easy path and I consider successfully running my own business one of my greatest feats.

    <h2>DESIGN</h2>
    <p>
      Formally trained at the University of Denver, I love clean typography, creating beautiful word marks and intuitive UIs. I'm well versed in the Adobe Suite, with my focus on Illustrator and Photoshop.

    <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
    <p>
      HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, PHP, Ruby, Python, ActionScript, ColdFusion. I've worked in many languages. In truth, I enjoy them all as long as the code created is beautiful and maintainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always have my eye out for the appropriate design pattern and I hate to reinventing the wheel.  My current favorite frameworks are Laravel and AngularJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I track and deploy using GIT.
